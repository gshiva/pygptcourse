from tracker import Tracker
from launcher import Launcher

class MainController(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.tracker = Tracker()
        self.launcher = Launcher()

    def run(self):
        # ... Main execution loop ...
```

### Design Rationale

- The modular design enhances maintainability and allows for easier future expansions or modifications. By separating the tracker and launcher code, both can independently developed and tested.

### 3.4 User Interface

This section addresses REQ-2.

Autonomous mode is the default mode of operation. Additionally, for manual operation during debugging or testing, the system includes a keyboard override interface. This interface allows operators to manually control the pan and tilt mechanism of the camera, providing direct and precise adjustments as needed.

### 3.4.1 Non-Blocking User Input Handling (Addressing REQ-7)

### Design for Non-Blocking User Input

- To ensure responsive user interaction and meet the performance requirement (REQ-7) of responding to user inputs within 1 second, the system will implement non-blocking user input handling.

- The design includes the use of threads to manage user input separately from the main application logic. This approach prevents user input from blocking the execution of critical tasks such as face recognition and camera control.

### Thread-Based Input Handling

- The system will create a dedicated input handling thread that continuously monitors user inputs, including commands from event operators or system administrators.

- This thread will be responsible for receiving and processing user requests without disrupting the core functionality of the T-shirt launcher.

### Asynchronous Command Queue

- User input commands will be placed in an asynchronous command queue by the input handling thread. These commands can include instructions to launch T-shirts, adjust camera settings, or activate debugging features.

- The main application logic, including face recognition and camera movement, will periodically check this command queue for new instructions.

### User Input Prioritization

- User input commands will be prioritized to ensure that safety-critical commands, such as emergency stop requests, receive immediate attention.

- The system will maintain a predefined order of priority for different types of user commands to optimize responsiveness.

### Synchronization and Communication

- Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, will be implemented to ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources, including the command queue.

- The input handling thread and the main application logic will communicate through the command queue to exchange information and execute commands.

### Production Mode and Observability

- In production mode, the user interface is designed to operate in a headless mode, without a graphical user interface (GUI). This minimizes resource usage and ensures efficient performance on less powerful hardware.

- Metrics, logs, and errors are routed to observability solutions such as monitoring dashboards and log aggregators. This allows operators to monitor the system's health and performance in real-time.

### Debugging Features

- For debugging purposes during development and testing, the user interface provides a visual representation of face recognition.

- When in debugging mode, the system launches a graphical interface that displays the live video feed. It identifies detected faces and draws a red rectangle around each identified face.

- Additionally, the name attached to each recognized face is displayed alongside the rectangle, aiding in debugging and verification of face recognition accuracy.

### 3.5 Safety Features

### Limitation of Pan and Tilt Mechanism

- The safety features of the system include settings that prevent the pan and tilt mechanism from crossing the physical limits of the device, even when instructed to do so. This ensures that the mechanical components operate within safe parameters and avoids potential damage.

### T-shirt Presence Detection

- To enhance safety, the system is designed to disable the launch mechanism when there is no T-shirt present in the launcher. This is achieved through sensors and image recognition. If the system detects the absence of a T-shirt in the launch chamber, it automatically prevents the launch operation from being executed.

### 3.6 Product Safety Suggestions

### To further enhance the safety of the product, the following design suggestions are proposed

- Safety Interlocks: Implement safety interlocks that ensure the launcher cannot be activated unless all safety checks are passed. This includes verifying the presence of a T-shirt, confirming that the pan and tilt mechanisms are within safe limits, and checking for any obstructions in the launch path.

- Emergency Stop Button: Incorporate an emergency stop button or mechanism that allows operators to quickly halt the launcher's operation in case of any unforeseen issues or emergencies.

- User Training and Guidelines: Provide comprehensive user training and safety guidelines for operators. Ensure that they are aware of the proper procedures for setting up and operating the T-shirt launcher safely.

    # Setup the mock as needed, e.g., setting return values for methods
    mock.aim.return_value = None
    mock.fire.return_value = None
    return mock

@pytest.fixture
def tracker_with_mocked_launcher(mock_launcher):
    # Patching the Launcher instance within the Tracker module
    with patch('tracker.Launcher', mock_launcher):
        # Initialize the Tracker with the mocked Launcher
        tracker = Tracker()
        yield tracker

def test_tracker_initialization(tracker_with_mocked_launcher):
    # Test the initialization of the Tracker module with a mocked Launcher
    tracker = tracker_with_mocked_launcher
