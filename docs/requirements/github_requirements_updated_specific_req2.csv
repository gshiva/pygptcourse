REQ-1: Documentation for setup and deployment,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Documentation includes setup instructions for the face recognition system, including the installation of necessary libraries (e.g., cv2, face_recognition).
- Detailed steps for deploying the camera control and T-shirt launcher systems.
- Information on how to configure the USB connection for the T-shirt launcher.
- Guidelines for setting image resolution and camera movement parameters.

REQ-2: Implement user control interface for manual overrides,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Development of a user interface that allows manual control and overrides of both the camera and the T-shirt launcher.
- The interface should enable users to manually adjust camera movement (left, right, up, down) and control launcher actions (fire, stop).
- Real-time response to user inputs, with immediate execution of the manual commands.
- The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback.

REQ-3: Implement T-shirt launcher control logic,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Control logic for the T-shirt launcher that interprets and executes commands for movement and firing.
- Integration with a USB device to send commands to the physical launcher.
- Implementation of safety measures to prevent accidental firing and to stop the launcher when required.

REQ-4: Integrate face recognition with camera movement,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Face recognition system that can identify specific individuals from images.
- Camera movement that responds to the position of the recognized face, adjusting to keep the face centered in the frame.
- Empirical calculations for camera movement to ensure smooth tracking of the face.

REQ-5: Develop camera movement logic based on face position,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Development of logic to move the camera left, right, up, and down based on the position of the recognized face in the video feed.
- Camera should adjust its position in real-time to ensure the face remains centered in the frame.
- The logic must be capable of handling different face sizes and distances from the camera.

REQ-6: Integrate camera movement with T-shirt launcher targeting,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Integration of the camera's movement logic with the T-shirt launcher's targeting system.
- Ensuring that the T-shirt launcher aims based on the camera's focus, particularly the position of a recognized face.
- Synchronization of camera movement and launcher aiming to ensure accurate targeting.
- The system should be able to track and adjust the launcher's aim in real-time as the target moves.

REQ-7: Implement safety features for T-shirt launcher,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Implementation of safety mechanisms to prevent accidental firing of the T-shirt launcher.
- Safety interlocks that ensure the launcher only fires under safe conditions.
- Clear indicators or warnings when the launcher is armed or in a ready-to-fire state.
","requirements, Implementation, Medium",3,,open
REQ-8: Error handling in face recognition logic,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Robust error handling for face recognition processes, ensuring stability even with poor image quality or occluded faces.
- Graceful handling of situations where no faces are detected or multiple faces are present.
- Logging and notification mechanisms for face recognition failures or anomalies.
","requirements, Implementation, High",3,,open
REQ-9: Error handling in camera control logic,"
**Acceptance Criteria**
- Comprehensive error handling in the camera control logic to address potential hardware or software failures.
- Mechanisms to recover from or gracefully handle camera movement errors or malfunctions.
- Detailed logging of any issues encountered during camera operation for troubleshooting purposes.
