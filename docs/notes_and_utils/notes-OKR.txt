# Some notes when reading through the OKRs
------------------------------------------

- OKRs talk a lot about missle and firing. With the recent world events it is best to find alterante examples. Replace the missiles wtih t-shirt cannon at at a basketball event.

- There are 40+ uses of "missile" in the OKRs. Consider renaming

- There are no explicit OKRs for the chapters 1 and 2. Why so?

- The sections are organized as: "Objective / Key Results / Key Initiatives / Methods to Measure Success". Is that the pattern?

- The subsections are not structured consistently. Ex: Chapter 3 has a header for "Key Results". But, Chapter 4 does not has a header for "Key Results".

- the "header style" applied is inconsisetnt for the "Objective / Key Results / Key Initiatives / Methods to Measure Success" in different chapters. Ex: see Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 as an examples

- Aren't we listing too many Key Results and Initiatives per chapter. Would it not be easier to just have max of 3 per

- In Chapter 6, there is a high level statement about PR metrics. Does the book chapter  cover what metrics are of importance? Or is the intent to have chatGPT help in this as well?
